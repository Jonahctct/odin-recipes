        </li>
        <li>For best results, preheat an outdoor grill. The oven broiler or a cast-iron 
        can also be used. Place steaks on the grill, season again with salt and pepper. 
        Cook approximately 4-6 minutes per side.
        </li>
        <li>After resting, slice the steaks against the grain, at you desired thickness.
        </li>
        <li>Warm tortillas in skillet or on the grill for about 30 seconds.
        Stack the tortillas, and wrap in foil to keep warm.
        </li>
        <li>To assemble tacos, add slices of steak, chopped onions, cilantro, pico de gallo
        and cheese to each tortilla. Finish with a squeeze of fresh lime and enjoy!
